Code status (1/11/26)
- Achievements (works but keeps repeating on every trigger event)
- KillAura (untested)
- Developer Items (Works | split into multiple worktables because of the code size)
- Day/Night cycle (bloxd updates broke the original but there is new code that needs to be tested)
- Custom Death Messages (mostly works but stopped trying because of how big the file would need to be for every type of death)
- Skins (original skins code messed up by new bloxd skins | now you can update poses, entity nodes, and new api for changing skin)
- Totem of Undying (mostly works | check fullWorldCode for a better one)
- Mace Code (does work | uses artisan axe for the item)
- Mace PvP kit (MisterCasino's code) (works kinda, but would need to be edited)
- Wind Charges (works, pretty simple (also check fullWorldCode for some)
- Music (was a random code I had so it doesn't work rly)
- randomcodes (a place to store all the random pieces of cool code that I didnt need a new file for (ex. particles on a player)
